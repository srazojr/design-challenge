The HDMI port on the BeagleBone Black is implemented as a virtual cape. This virtual cape uses pins on the expansion headers, limiting the available pins. If you don’t need HDMI you gain 20 more GPIO pins by disabling  the HDMI cape. Other reasons for disabling HDMI are to make UART 5 and the flow control for UART 3 and 4 available or to get more PWM pins. Follow the instructions below to disable the HDMI cape and make pins 27 to 46 on header P8 available.


Before you start, it’s always a good idea to update your BeagleBone Black with the latest Angstrom image.
Use SSH to connect to the BeagleBone Black. You can use the web based GateOne SSH client or use PuTTY and connect to beaglebone.local or 192.168.7.2
user name: root 
password: <enter>

Mount the FAT partition:
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1  /mnt/card

Edit the uEnv.txt on the mounted partition:
nano /mnt/card/uEnv.txt

To disable the HDMI Cape, change the contents of uEnv.txt to:
optargs=quiet capemgr.disable_partno=BB-BONELT-HDMI,BB-BONELT-HDMIN

Save the file:
Ctrl-X, Y

Unmount the partition:
umount /mnt/card

Reboot the board:
shutdown -r now

Wait about 10 seconds and reconnect to the BeagleBone Black through SSH. To see what capes are enabled:
cat /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots

Every line shows something like “P-O-L” or “P-O–”. The letter “L” means the Cape is enabled; no letter “L” means that it is disabled. You can see here that the HDMI Cape has been disabled, so pin 27 to 46 on header P8 are now available to use.

for ubuntu the file is in /boot/uEnv.txt
